# 1. Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:
#    - Use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version to determine the web server version

#    - Run auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner to discover hidden directories
#    - Utilize auxiliary/scanner/http/http_header to analyze HTTP headers for potential vulnerabilities
#
# 2. Port Scanning and Service Enumeration:
#    - Execute auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp for a comprehensive TCP port scan
#    - Use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn for a stealthy SYN scan
#    - Run auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version to identify SSH version if port 22 is open

# 3. Web Application Analysis:
#    - Use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_listing to check for directory listing vulnerabilities
#    - Run auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir to search for sensitive files
#    - Employ auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login for potential web login pages

#    - If vulnerabilities are found, use appropriate exploit modules (not listed in auxiliary modules)
#
# 6. Post-Exploitation and Further Enumeration:
#    - If access is gained, use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares for SMB share enumeration
#    - Employ auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumusers to list potential users
#    - Run auxiliary/scanner/mssql/mssql_login for MSSQL database access attempts
#
# 7. Data Exfiltration and Analysis:
#    - Use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_pdf_authors to gather potential user information from PDF metadata
#    - Employ auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir to locate and download sensitive files
#    - Run auxiliary/analyze/crack_databases if any database hashes are obtained
