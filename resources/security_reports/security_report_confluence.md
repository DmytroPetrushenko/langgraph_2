### Summary of Findings

#### 1. Overview
This document summarizes the results of the final pentest conducted on the Confluence server located at http://34.241.130.103:8090/. The testing focused on exploiting known vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2023-22515, CVE-2023-22527, and OGNL injection.

#### 2. Modules Executed
The following Metasploit modules were executed during the testing phase:

1. **Auxiliary Module**:
   - `auxiliary/admin/http/atlassian_confluence_auth_bypass`
   
2. **Exploit Modules**:
   - `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_confluence_rce_cve_2023_22515`
   - `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_confluence_rce_cve_2023_22527`
   - `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_confluence_webwork_ognl_injection`
   - `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_crowd_pdkinstall_plugin_upload_rce` (with ForceExploit option)

#### 3. Results

1. **Authentication Bypass**:
   - **Module**: `auxiliary/admin/http/atlassian_confluence_auth_bypass`
   - **Result**: The target appears to be vulnerable. However, the attempt to create an admin user failed due to the username already existing or insufficient permissions.
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     [+] The target appears to be vulnerable. Exploitable version of Confluence: 8.0.0
     [-] Auxiliary aborted due to failure: no-access: The admin user could not be created. Try a different username.
     ```

2. **RCE CVE-2023-22515**:
   - **Module**: `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_confluence_rce_cve_2023_22515`
   - **Result**: The exploit was attempted, but no session was created due to an inability to reliably check exploitability.
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     [-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unknown: Cannot reliably check exploitability. No 'X-Confluence-Request-Time' header.
     ```

3. **RCE CVE-2023-22527**:
   - **Module**: `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_confluence_rce_cve_2023_22527`
   - **Result**: The exploit was executed, but no session was created.
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     Exploit completed, but no session was created.
     ```

4. **OGNL Injection**:
   - **Module**: `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_confluence_webwork_ognl_injection`
   - **Result**: The target was confirmed to be vulnerable to OGNL injection, but no session was created.
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     [+] The target is vulnerable. Successfully tested OGNL injection.
     ```

5. **Crowd PDK Install Plugin Upload RCE**:
   - **Module**: `exploit/multi/http/atlassian_crowd_pdkinstall_plugin_upload_rce`
   - **Result**: The exploit was attempted with ForceExploit, but the target did not respond as expected, indicating it is not vulnerable.
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     [!] The target is not exploitable. Target didn't respond that it couldn't install an invalid plugin, so it's not vulnerable!
     ```

#### 4. Errors Encountered
- **Authentication Bypass**: Failed to create an admin user due to existing username or permission issues.
- **RCE Exploits**: Both RCE exploits failed to create sessions, with one indicating a lack of necessary headers for exploitability checks.
- **Crowd PDK Exploit**: The target did not respond as expected, indicating it is not vulnerable.

#### 5. Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: Consider testing with different usernames for the authentication bypass.
- **Module Updates**: Ensure that all Metasploit modules are up to date to avoid issues with exploitability checks.
- **Manual Testing**: For the RCE vulnerabilities, manual testing may be required to confirm exploitability.

### 
This concludes the final testing phase of the Confluence server. The results indicate potential vulnerabilities, but successful exploitation was not achieved in this round. Further actions may be necessary to fully assess the security posture of the server.
