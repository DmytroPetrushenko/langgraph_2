# Security Assessment Report for 63.251.228.70

## Executive Summary

A security assessment was conducted on the host 63.251.228.70 using various Metasploit modules. The assessment revealed several potential security concerns, including open ports, SSL/TLS configuration details, and web server information. No critical vulnerabilities were identified, but some areas require attention to improve the overall security posture.

## Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Open Ports

**Finding**: The scan revealed two open ports:
- Port 2000 (TCP)
- Port 5060 (TCP)

**Risk**: Medium

**Recommendation**: 
- Review the necessity of these open ports.
- If not required, close these ports to reduce the attack surface.
- If required, ensure they are properly secured and monitored.

### 2. SSL/TLS Configuration

**Finding**: The server supports TLSv1.2 with various cipher suites.

**Risk**: Low

**Recommendation**: 
- Regularly review and update SSL/TLS configurations.
- Consider disabling older cipher suites and prioritizing more secure options.
- Implement perfect forward secrecy (PFS) if not already in use.

### 3. SSL Certificate

**Finding**: 
- The SSL certificate is valid from 2024-09-02 to 2025-10-04.
- Common Name: *.exigeninsurance.com
- Issuer: Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority - G2

**Risk**: Low

**Recommendation**: 
- Ensure timely renewal of the SSL certificate.
- Consider implementing Certificate Transparency (CT) logging.
- Regularly audit the certificate to ensure it meets current security standards.

### 4. Web Server Information

**Finding**: Limited information was gathered about the web server configuration.

**Risk**: Low

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement proper security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy).
- Regularly update the web server software to the latest secure version.
- Configure the server to minimize information disclosure in headers and error messages.

### 5. Directory Structure

**Finding**: The server returns a 302 redirect for directory scans.

**Risk**: Low

**Recommendation**: 
- Review the redirect policy to ensure it doesn't disclose sensitive information.
- Implement proper access controls on all directories.
- Use a web application firewall (WAF) to add an extra layer of protection.

## Conclusion

While no critical vulnerabilities were identified, several areas require attention to enhance the overall security posture. The main focus should be on reviewing the necessity of open ports, optimizing SSL/TLS configurations, and ensuring proper web server security measures are in place.

## Next Steps

1. Conduct a thorough review of the open ports (2000 and 5060) and their associated services.
2. Perform a detailed analysis of the web application, including manual testing and code review if possible.
3. Implement the recommended security measures and conduct a follow-up assessment to verify improvements.

This report provides an overview based on the automated scans performed. A more comprehensive assessment, including manual testing and in-depth analysis, is recommended for a complete security evaluation.
